# Hi, I'm Marcos Taveira - Aspiring Brazilian Software Engineer and Lawyer.

Welcome to my coding journey! 👋

## About Me

I'm Marcos, a Brazilian lawyer with a passion for technology and software engineering. Recently, I embarked on an exciting journey to learn and explore the world of software development. This README serves as a brief introduction to who I am and what I'm working on.

## My Journey

- 🌐 My goal is to combine my legal background with software development to create innovative solutions for both the legal and coding industry.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on or have completed:
