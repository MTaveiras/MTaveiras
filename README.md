# Hi, I'm Marcos Taveira - Aspiring Brazilian Software Engineer and Lawyer.

Welcome to my coding journey! 👋

## About Me

I'm Marcos, a Brazilian lawyer with a passion for technology and software engineering. Recently, I embarked on an exciting journey to learn and explore the world of software development. This README serves as a brief introduction to who I am and what I'm working on.

## My Journey

- 📚 I'm currently studying Software Engineering, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in this field.
- 💻 I'm currently learning C, C++, HTML, JavaScript and CSS and working on personal coding projects to build my skills.
- 🌐 My goal is to combine my legal background with software development to create innovative solutions for both the legal and coding industry.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on or have completed:

- Speaker for the Pontificia universidade Católica de Minas Gerais's team at the JESSUP 2021 Competition: The Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition is an advocacy competition for law students. Teams of law students compete against one another through the presentation of oral and written pleadings to address timely issues of public international law in the context of a hypothetical legal dispute between nations.
- "Libertas" Debating Group - Puc Minas - Praça da Liberdade Competitive debating organization based on the English model of Oxford University.
- "Alain Pellet" Study Group - Puc Minas - Praça da Liberdade Coordinated by Professor Ricardo Guerra.
